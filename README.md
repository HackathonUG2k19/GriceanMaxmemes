# Confessions Generator

This is a web-app for generating confessions, using a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with a dataset of 20k confessions (pre-cleaning) scraped from Facebook Confessions Pages of various universities. The language model used the pre-trained GPT-2 Model, by OpenAI. For better speed and usability, the entire web-app was based on vanilla JavaScript, and uses the pre-generated dataset.
